# Next.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR) model

## Overview

This project is a Next.js application that demonstrates server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. Next.js is a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. SSR allows you to render pages on the server before sending them to the client, improving performance and SEO.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Pages are rendered on the server for faster initial page loads and better SEO.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Includes support for dynamic routes.
- **API Routes**: Provides backend functionality within the same application.
- **Custom Document and App**: Customizes the HTML document structure and application behavior.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/dushyant4665/nextjs-server-side-rendering.git
   cd nextjs-server-side-rendering


### Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:
```bash
npm install
````

or if you prefer using Yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```
To build and start the production server:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

#### Configuration
## Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add any required environment variables. Example:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
API_KEY=your-api-key
```



























This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
